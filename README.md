# BigBookOfSmallScalaProjects

This project is an effort to learn a bit about programming in scala with an effects system like cats effect.

The repo contains implementations for the programs described in the "Big Book of Small Python Projects" ( https://nostarch.com/big-book-small-python-projects ) but then instead of using Python (brr....), I use Scala & Cats Effect.
